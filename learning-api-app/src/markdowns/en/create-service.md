First of all, create a service. There is no specific naming convention on creating one. A good rule of thumb will work-[your-name]-[appname] eg: work-photon-business.
Services can be created from the administration screen. If the service is successfully created, a sub-domain of the service name will be assigned to it as shown below.

```
http(s)://{service name}.vte.cx
```

It would be also nice if you have google translate extensions/addon to your google chrome browser (if you are using one)

All the examples in this documentation are shown using http and this vte.cx can also be used with https
